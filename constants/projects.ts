 * Data Structures for project whole functionality of the app
 *here step changed like this way
 * intially project name will display   consider as project id page with title name will display in  index page
 *  after clicking on index page project name it will navigate to project id page
 * there project  sub checks  will display like  checks [] array items  
 * Example : -  
  Project (Level 1)
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Check / Section (Level 2)
 ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sub-Check / Audit List Item (Level 3)
 ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PhotoReview[] (Level 4)
 ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ             ‚Ü≥ status: pass/fail
 ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ             ‚Ü≥ reason: process miss / technical miss
 ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ             ‚Ü≥ corrective measure
 ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ
 ‚îÇ     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Actions at Project Level:
       - Process Missed
       - Errors
       - Update to client
 * for each check user will upload photos user will  review the each photo and submit the project 
 *      inside the each quality check like   photo with two options  1. fail(design failed)  2. pass(design passed)
 * after submitting the project  project will be marked as completed true ( after clicking on submit button a form will open ask for  enter email id and name    after entering  project status will go to mail  to the entered email id )
 * after completing the project  it will display in completed project page
